# Bot Builder SDK 

If you are new to the Bot Builder SDK, we strongly encourage your to build you bot using the [v4 SDK](https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder).  

This repo contains version 3.

The Bot Builder SDK enables you to build bots that support different types of interactions with users. You can design conversations in your bot to be freeform. Your bot can also have more guided interactions where it provides the user choices or actions. The conversation can use simple text or more complex rich cards that contain text, images, and action buttons. You can add natural language interactions and questions and answers, which let your users interact with your bots in a natural way.

![Bot Framework](https://botframework.blob.core.windows.net/web/images/bot-framework.png)

The Bot Builder includes a set of [command line tools](https://github.com/microsoft/botbuilder-tools) to streamline end-to-end conversation centric development experience, and an [emulator](https://github.com/microsoft/botframework-emulator) for debugging your bot locally or in the cloud.
