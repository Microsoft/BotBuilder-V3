# V3 Deprecation Notification

Microsoft Bot Framework SDK V4 was released in September 2018, and since then we have shipped a few dot-release improvements. As announced previously, the V3  SDK is being retired with final long-term support ending on December 31st, 2019.
Accordingly, there will be no more development in this repo. **Existing V3 bot workloads will continue to run without interruption. We have no plans to disrupt any running workloads**.

We highly recommend that you start migrating your V3 bots to V4. In order to support this migration we have produced migration documentation and will provide extended support for migration initiatives (via standard channels such as Stack Overflow and Microsoft Customer Support).

# Bot Builder SDK 

If you are new to the Bot Builder SDK, we strongly encourage you to build your bot using the [v4 SDK](https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder).  

This repo contains version 3.

The Bot Builder SDK enables you to build bots that support different types of interactions with users. You can design conversations in your bot to be freeform. Your bot can also have more guided interactions where it provides the user choices or actions. The conversation can use simple text or more complex rich cards that contain text, images, and action buttons. You can add natural language interactions and questions and answers, which let your users interact with your bots in a natural way.

![Bot Framework](https://botframework.blob.core.windows.net/web/images/bot-framework.png)

The Bot Builder includes a set of [command line tools](https://github.com/microsoft/botbuilder-tools) to streamline end-to-end conversation centric development experience, and an [emulator](https://github.com/microsoft/botframework-emulator) for debugging your bot locally or in the cloud. 

You can create a bot with Bot Builder v3 SDK using your favorite language: 
- [.NET](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/?view=azure-bot-service-3.0)
- [JavaScript](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/?view=azure-bot-service-3.0)

## Adding intelligence to your bot
Your bot can provide a great conversational experience without using any Azure Cognitive Services. You can increase your customers' delight with adding a more natural interaction using one or multiple Azure Cognitive Services.  The following are common services integrated to bots: 
- [LUIS](https://www.luis.ai)
- [QnA Maker](https://www.qnamaker.ai/)
- [Speech](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cognitive-services/directory/speech/)
- [Personality Chat](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotBuilder-PersonalityChat) - Handles Small-Talk/Chitchat for any bot, in line with a distinct personality.
- all [Azure Cognitive Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cognitive-services/)
